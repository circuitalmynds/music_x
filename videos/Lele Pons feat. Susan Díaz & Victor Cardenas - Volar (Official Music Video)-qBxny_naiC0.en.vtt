00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.580
You know that loving me has always been just a game

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.120
You tell me you love me but I don’t believe you

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.140
Because what we had was never that good love

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.640
I only know how to suffer

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.480
You think I walk in your poison

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.040
But you forget that I don’t walk

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.280
I learned how to fly

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.200
Fly, fly

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.560
I don’t walk

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.140
I learned how to fly

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.380
You won’t be my addiction

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.500
Because I’m better on my own

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.700
You were a shooting star

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.420
You think I walk in your poison

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.020
But you forget that I don’t walk

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.440
I learned how to fly

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.840
Fly, fly

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.860
I don’t walk

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.460
I learned how to fly

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.920
And fly

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.460
Without you, I learned how to fly

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.600
Learned how to fly

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.960
Learned how to fly

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.520
hey

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.600
